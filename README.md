# CareOf - Android App

Nowadays, dependent people can improve their life quality thank to new mobile technologies.
If there is a child, an old person or a disabled person in your family, 
you might have ever worried about how he/she is and if he/she is being well assisted.
Would it not be nice to have a tool on your mobile phone to keep contact with the dependent person's carer? Here you are CareOf.

CareOf is an Android App that will enable you to communicate constantly with the carer while adding other 
functionalities like a shared agenda that allows us to know the activities scheduled for today or alerts that can be used to send
critical messages and piece of information that need to be read as soon as posible.

CareOf was developed with Android Studio and it uses Google services like Firebase.
This is an early version of the App and it is still being developed. Other functions will be added soon. 
For the time being, it works properly and has a simple but friendly user interface that helps us interact easily with it.

# Android: Java. 
# Firebase API: Authentication, Database, Storage.
